## 🧠 Overview  

**Stray** is an evocative third-person adventure where players embody a curious cat navigating a sprawling, neon-drenched urban labyrinth. The world feels both futuristic and forgotten, filled with towering structures, narrow alleyways, and remnants of a society long past.

In this atmospheric experience, movement and exploration are central. The agile feline protagonist scales obstacles, squeezes through tight passages, and leaps across rooftops with responsive and intuitive controls. Environmental storytelling is key; every corner holds a new mystery or visual detail waiting to be uncovered.

Interactions with robotic denizens and hidden environments deepen immersion, while environmental puzzles keep progress engaging without detracting from the mood. Stray’s world is rich with texture and subtle narrative threads, making each exploration session feel rewarding and fresh.
